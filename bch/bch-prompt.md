## Bitcoin Cash (BCH)

When working with the BCH blockchain, you should use the minimal-slp-wallet and bch-js JavaScript libraries. minimal-slp-wallet hash high-level abstracted functions for common workflows. bch-js has much more low-level functions. minimal-slp-wallet is built on top of bch-js, and bch-js is embedded inside the minimal-slp-wallet library.

- A README for minimal-slp-wallet is available here: [minimal-slp-wallet-readme.md](./minimal-slp-wallet-readme.md)
